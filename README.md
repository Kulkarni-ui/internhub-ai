# InternHub AI – Internship Matching System

## Project Overview
InternHub AI is a lightweight AI-inspired internship matching system that analyzes a student’s skills against an internship job description. It identifies matched skills, skill gaps, calculates an ATS confidence score, and generates a resume summary.

This project focuses on AI reasoning and logic rather than complex backend systems or paid APIs.
